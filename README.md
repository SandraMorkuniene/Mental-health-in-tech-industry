The aim of this work is to analyze Mental Health in the Tech Industry dataset and evaluate the openess to disclose mental health issues in different work contexts such as while talking with the potential employer (also compare to physical health issues); while talking with the coworkers or direct manager. Gender also will be taken into account while evaluating the openess to talk. Lastly, evaluate prevalence rate of having mental health disorder across the years and prevalence rate having at least two mental disorders in 2016.

# Objectives
* Present the sample of the surveys.
* Analyze openess to talk about mental health issues in the different work contexts:
  1) Be open about mental vs physical health with the potential employer;
  2) Be open about mental health issues with direct manager vs coworkers vs potential employer;
  3) Evaluate gender differences for these contexts while disclosing mental health issues.
* Evaluate the prevalence rate of having mental disease across the years and having at least two mental diseases in 2016.

# Main insights
*   The sample consisted of mainly male respondents those age ranged from 25 to 39 years old (~50% of the sample). 61% of respondents were located in the United States, ~15% of them from California state. The first three countries by the number of respondents were English speaking. 42% respondents worked in a small company (less than 100 employees), 68% indicated that their company was primarily tech industry company. Biased sample supposed the limitations for the generalization of the results.
<br>

*   44% of respondents indicated that had family history of mental illness, and 57% of respondents were looking for treatment from a mental health professional in the past. In 2016 - 2019 year surveys, 48% of respondents indicated that they had mental health disorder in the past, 42% of respondents had mental health disorder in the moment of filling questionnaire.
<br>

*   More than 3 times often respondents were willing to talk about physical health issues compare to mental health issues with the potential employer (only 5.4% respondents were open to talk about mental health issues compare to 21% for physical health issues). Females compare to male and the other gender were the least willing to talk about mental and physical health issues with the potential employer. The other gender didn't significantly differ from the males in openess to talk about mental or physical health issues.
<br>

*   It was expected that the least people will be willing to talk about mental issues with the potential employer compare to the coworkers and the direct manager. It was confirmed since only 5.4% of respondents were willing to share mental health issues compare to 21% of those willing to share mental health issues with coworkers and 34% of those willing to share it with the direct manager. Females compare to males and the other gender were less willing to talk about mental health issues with the direct manager and potential employer. Females compare to the other gender were less willing to talk about mental health issues with the coworkers. No differences between females and males for openess with coworkers identified. 
<br>

*  Practical implications of the analysis done on the openess to talk about mental issues for the companies' HR could be to prepare and use direct managers as a channel to talk about mental health issues (since people mostly trusted them). Females were the most secretative about any kind of issues which could make them vulnerable in tech industry, knowing that HR could make females as  priority target audience for any kind of future intervention on mental health topic. 
<br>

*  The prevalence rate of having mental health disorder for the period from 2016 to 2019 ranged in the interval from 40 to 50%. Only 2018 year's prevalence rate significantly differed from 2016 year's prevalence rate. In 2018 the prevalence rate of having mental health disorder was the highest (45.80%; 95% CI 41-50.6%).
<br>
 
*  The prevalence rate of having at least two mental health disorders in 2016 was 25.6% (CI 23.42%;27.93%).
